Win32-libraries for Lightspark by Brian Richardson (brian at gameclay dot com)

Based on work by Aaron Gray (http://www.cybercomms.org/lightspark-win32/)

I've been working to enable CMake generation of Visual Studio (and potentially nmake) builds of Lightspark.  To do this:

0.  Clone this repo.  It doesn't matter where, but I've set my directory structure up to look like this:
      lightspark/ -- base dir
      lightspark/lightspark -- clone of the lightspark repo I'm working with
      lightspark/win32libs-lightspark -- clone of this repo
1.  Run vcvarsall.bat from your Visual Studio Directory.
2.  Run setlibs.bat from where you've cloned this repo to.  (lightspark/win32libs-lightspark in my case)
3.  Create a build directory.  (Example:  lightspark/lightspark/objs)
4.  From that directory, run cmake ..

Open solution and build!
